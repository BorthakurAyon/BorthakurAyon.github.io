“ No great thing is created suddenly, any more than a bunch of grapes or a fig. If you tell me that you desire a fig, I answer that there must be time. Let it first blossom, then bear fruit, then ripen. ”
― Epictetus

" The future of computing is analog. These new “mortal” computers will be used for putting something like GPT-3 in your toaster for one dollar ..."
― Geoffrey Hinton, NeurIPS 2022. 

### Welkom!

My interest is focused on **real-time AI system** design for practical applications. These systems have a wide range of applications, including but not limited to fields such as sensor edge AI, robotics, automation, and healthcare. Toward that goal, I do research on deep neural networks, sensor signal processing, and also work on overcoming the current limitations of AI by drawing inspiration from sensory neuroscience such as smell and vision.

### Research Areas
Embedded AI systems, Deep learning, Neuromorphic computing, Computational neuroscience

### About me
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at IIT Hyderabad. Previously, I worked at Innatera Nanosystems in the Netherlands as a Senior Neuromorphic Engineer-Machine Learning. At Innatera, I worked on marrying deep learning and analog computing towards ultra-low power and latency radar target recognition, which resulted in multiple patent applications. Before that, I completed my Ph.D. at Cornell University, USA. As part of my Ph.D., I worked on neuroscience-inspired Artificial Intelligence for learning in the wild, focusing on its implementation in neuromorphic chips such as Intel Loihi. My PhD work is part of an international patent sponsored by Cornell. I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering from IIT Dhanbad.

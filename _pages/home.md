### Openings

The lab is currently accepting applications for many tinyML system design projects that focus on radar, touch, smell, and vision sensors as well as neuromorphic systems and computational neuroscience. Through these initiatives, one can develop competence in deep learning & other areas of AI/ML, sensor data encoding & signal processing, computer architecture, neuromorphic computing/engineering, and neuroscience. Please send an email to ayon.borthakur@iitg.ac.in if you are motivated. 

### Welkom!

My interest is focused on **real-time AI system** design for practical applications. These systems have a wide range of applications, including but not limited to fields such as sensor edge AI, robotics, automation, and healthcare. Toward that goal, I do research on deep neural networks, and sensor signal processing, and also work on overcoming the current limitations of AI by drawing inspiration from sensory neuroscience such as smell and vision.

### Research Areas
Embedded AI systems/Edge AI/TinyML, Deep learning, Neuromorphic computing, Computational neuroscience

### About me
I am an Assistant Professor at the Mehta Family School of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, IIT Guwahati. Before that, I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at IIT Hyderabad. Previously, I worked at Innatera Nanosystems in the Netherlands as a Senior Neuromorphic Engineer-Machine Learning. At Innatera, I worked on marrying deep learning and analog computing towards ultra-low power and latency radar target recognition, which resulted in multiple patent applications. Before that, I completed my Ph.D. at Cornell University, USA. As part of my Ph.D., I worked on neuroscience-inspired Artificial Intelligence for learning in the wild, focusing on its implementation in neuromorphic chips such as Intel Loihi. My PhD work is part of an international patent sponsored by Cornell. I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering from IIT Dhanbad.

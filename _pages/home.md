### Openings

We are hiring for projects pertaining to the following subjects.  

* TinyML for Computer Vision applications
* TinyML for Radar applications
* TinyML for tactile applications
* AI Inspired by Neuroscience
* Neuromorphic Computing \& Engineering

Please send an email to **ayon.borthakur@iitg.ac.in** if you are motivated. 

### Welkom!

My interest is focused on **real-time AI system** design for practical applications. These systems have a wide range of applications, including but not limited to fields such as sensor edge AI, robotics, automation, and healthcare. Toward that goal, I do research on deep neural networks, and sensor signal processing, and also work on overcoming the current limitations of AI by drawing inspiration from cognitive science of smell, touch, and vision.

### Research Areas
Embedded AI systems/Edge AI/TinyML, Deep learning, Neuromorphic computing, Computational cognitive neuroscience

### About me
I am an Assistant Professor at the Mehta Family School of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, IIT Guwahati. Before that, I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at IIT Hyderabad. Previously, I worked at Innatera Nanosystems in the Netherlands as a Senior Neuromorphic Engineer-Machine Learning. At Innatera, I worked on marrying deep learning and analog computing towards ultra-low power and latency radar target recognition, which resulted in multiple patent applications. Before that, I completed my Ph.D. at Cornell University, USA. As part of my Ph.D., I worked on neuroscience-inspired Artificial Intelligence for learning in the wild, focusing on its implementation in neuromorphic chips such as Intel Loihi. My PhD work is part of an international patent sponsored by Cornell. I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering from IIT Dhanbad.

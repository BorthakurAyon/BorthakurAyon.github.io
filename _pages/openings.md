The lab is currently accepting applications for many tinyML system design projects that focus on vision, radar, touch, and smell sensors as well as neuromorphic system design projects and cognitive science projects. One can opt to gain expertise in one or more fields through these initiatives, including  deep learning (and other AI/ML domains), sensor data encoding and signal processing, computer architecture, neuromorphic computing/engineering, and cognitive science. Please send an email to **ayon.borthakur@iitg.ac.in** if you are motivated.

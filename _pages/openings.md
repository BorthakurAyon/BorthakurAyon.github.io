The lab is currently accepting applications for many tinyML system design projects that focus on radar, touch, smell, and vision sensors as well as neuromorphic systems and computational neuroscience. Through these initiatives, one can develop competence in deep learning & other areas of AI/ML, sensor data encoding & signal processing, computer architecture, neuromorphic computing/engineering, and neuroscience. Please send an email to **ayon.borthakur@iitg.ac.in** if you are motivated.

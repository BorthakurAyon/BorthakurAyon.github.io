The lab is currently accepting applications for many tinyML system design projects that focus on radar, touch, smell, and vision sensors as well as neuromorphic systems and computational neuroscience. One can opt to gain expertise in one or more fields through these initiatives, including  deep learning (and other AI/ML domains), sensor data encoding and signal processing, computer architecture, neuromorphic computing/engineering, and neuroscience. Please send an email to **ayon.borthakur@iitg.ac.in** if you are motivated.
